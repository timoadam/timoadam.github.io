> Since June 2020, I work as a postdoctoral research fellow at the <span style="color: #1f96be;"><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of St Andrews</a></span>, where I am based at the <span style="color: #1f96be;"><a href="https://www.creem.st-andrews.ac.uk/" target="_blank"> Centre for Research into Ecological and Environmental Modelling (CREEM)</a></span>. Supervised by <span style="color: #1f96be;"><a href="http://www.richardglennie.co.uk/" target="_blank">Dr. Richard Glennie</a></span>, I currently work on (hierarchical) hidden Markov models. Between June 2016 and May 2020, I did a Ph.D. in economics (with a focus on statistics) at Bielefeld University, supervised by <span style="color: #1f96be;"><a href="https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/wirtschaftswissenschaften/lehrbereiche/stats/team/prof.-dr.-roland-langrock/" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. Roland Langrock</a></span>.

Research interests
======

I am passionate about developing innovative statistical methods and their application in ecology (animal movement modelling) and economics (financial time series modelling). In particular, my research focuses on the following topics:

- Hidden Markov models and their extensions.
- Non-parametric modelling techniques, particularly based on penalised B-splines.
- Statistical software development in R.
- Applications in ecology and economics.

A list of publications is available <span style="color: #1f96be;"><a href="https://timoadam.github.io//publications/">here</a></span>.
