Research Interests
======
I am passionate about developing innovative statistical methods and their application in ecology (satellite tracking/animal movement modeling) and economics/finance (stock market modeling). In particular, my research focuses on the following topics:

- Hidden Markov models.
- Non-parametric modeling techniques.
- Spatial capture-recapture models. 
- Applications in ecology.
- Applications in economics.

A brief introduction of selected topics can be found <span style="color: #1f96be;">here</span>. A list of all publictions can be found <span style="color: #1f96be;">here</span>.
