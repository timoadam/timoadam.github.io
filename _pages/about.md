I am a postdoctoral researcher in statistics at the University of St Andrews, School of Mathematics and Statistics.

Research Interests
======
I am passionate about developing innovative statistical methods and their application in ecology (satellite tracking/animal movement modeling) and economics/finance (stock market modeling).

1. Hidden Markov models.
2. Non-parametric modeling techniques.
3. Spatial capture-recapture models. 
4. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
5. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
6. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.
