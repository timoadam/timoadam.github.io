> Since June 2020, I work as a postdoctoral research fellow at the <span style="color: #1f96be;"><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics/" target="_blank">School of Mathematics and Statistics</a></span> of the <span style="color: #1f96be;"><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of St Andrews</a></span>, where I am based at the <span style="color: #1f96be;"><a href="https://www.creem.st-andrews.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Centre for Research into Ecological and Environmental Modelling (CREEM)</a></span>. I am passionate about developing innovative statistical methods and their application in ecology (animal movement modelling) and economics (financial time series modelling).
