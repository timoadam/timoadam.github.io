> My research focuses on the *development*, *implementation*, and *application* of innovative statistical methods for time series, particularly hidden Markov models and non-parametric modelling techniques. I am especially interested in their application in ecology (statistical modelling of animal movement data, e.g. GPS, dive, and acceleration data) and economics (statistical modelling of financial time series).

 > Hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs) generalise hidden Markov models (HMMs) by explicitly modelling the time spent in a given state, the so-called dwell time, using some distribution defined on the natural numbers. While the (shifted) Poisson and negative binomial distribution provide natural choices for such distributions, in practice, parametric distributions can lack the flexibility to adequately model the dwell times. To overcome this problem, a penalised maximum likelihood approach is proposed that allows for a flexible and data-driven estimation of the dwell-time distributions without the need to make any distributional assumption. This approach is suitable for direct modelling purposes or as an exploratory tool to investigate the latent state dynamics. The feasibility and potential of the suggested approach is illustrated in a simulation study and by modelling muskox movements in northeast Greenland using GPS tracking data.

> Understanding animal movement is essential to elucidate how animals interact, survive, and thrivein a changing world. Recent technological advances in data collection and management have transformedour understanding of animal "movement ecology" (the integrated study of organismal movement), creating a big-data discipline that benefits from rapid, cost-effective generation of large amounts of dataon movements of animals in the wild. These high-throughput wildlife tracking systems now allowmore thorough investigation of variation among individuals and species across space and time, thenature of biological interactions, and behavioral responses to the environment. Movement ecology israpidly expanding scientific frontiers through large interdisciplinary and collaborative frameworks, providing improved opportunities for conservation and insights into the movements of wild animals, and their causes and consequences.

*Methods in Ecology and Evolution*, 1-14.
> Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and their extensions are attractive methods for analysing ecological data where noisy, multivariate measurements are made of a hidden, ecological process, and where this hidden process is represented by a sequence of discrete states. Yet, as these models become more complex and challenging to understand, it is important to consider what pitfalls these methods have and what opportunities there are for future research to address these pitfalls. In this paper, we review five lesser known pitfalls one can encounter when using HMMs or their extensions to solve ecological problems. This review is for ecologists and ecological statisticians familiar with HMMs, but who may be less aware of the problems that arise in more specialised applications. We demonstrate how each pitfall arises, by simulation or example, and discuss why this pitfall is important to consider. Along with identifying the problems, we highlight potential research opportunities and offer ideas that may help alleviate these pitfalls. Each of the methods we review are solutions to current ecological research problems. We intend for this paper to heighten awareness of the pitfalls ecologists may encounter when applying these more advanced methods, but we also hope that by highlighting future research opportunities, we can inspire ecological statisticians to weaken these pitfalls and provide improved methods.
