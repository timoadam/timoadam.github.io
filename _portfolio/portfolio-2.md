title: "Hierarchical hidden Markov models for multi-scale time series"
excerpt: "While conventional hidden Markov models (HMMs) are restricted to modeling single-scale data, in practice variables are often observed at different temporal resolutions. An economy's gross domestic product, for instance, is typically observed on a yearly, quarterly, or monthly basis, whereas stock prices are available daily or at even finer resolutions. Step lengths performed by an animal, to give another example, are often observed on a daily or hourly basis, whereas accelerations obtained from accelerometers are available at much higher frequencies, with observations typically made several times per second. Hierarchical HMMs regard the observations as stemming from multiple, connected state processes, each of which operates at the time scale at which the corresponding variables were observed. <br/> <br/> <img src='/images/Project2.png' width = '384'> <br/> <br/> Click here to find out more about hierarchical HMMs."
