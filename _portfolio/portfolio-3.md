title: "Markov-switching generalised additive models for location, scale, and shape"
excerpt: "Markov-switching generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (Markov-switching GAMLSS) constitute a novel class of flexible latent-state time series regression models. In contrast to conventional Markov-switching regression models, they can be used to model different state-dependent parameters of the response distribution - not only the mean, but also variance, skewness, and kurtosis parameters - as potentially smooth functions of a given set of explanatory variables. <br/> <br/> <img src='/images/Project3.png' width='384'> <br/> <br/> Click here to find out more about Markov-switching GAMLSS."
